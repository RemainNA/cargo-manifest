# EDMC Cargo Manifest

A small plugin for [EDMC](https://github.com/EDCD/EDMarketConnector) that displays cargo type, quantity, mission, stolen status, and optionally average selling price, along with total cargo capacity.

## Installation

Download the latest release then extract the zip folder to your EDMC plugin folder (can be located through EDMC settings).

## Compatibility

This plugin is only compatible with Python 3 (EDMC versions greater than 3.46).  
EDMC versions 4.1.5 and earlier have known issues displaying cargo, but will still function.
